## 🌱 Intermediate Fundamentals

This section introduces essential concepts that take you beyond the basics — reusable **methods**, powerful **data structures** like **lists** and **maps**, and how to combine them to build more interesting and modular terminal applications.

---

### 🔧 1. Methods – Reusability and Clean Code

**Goal:** Learn to create and use your own methods to avoid repetition, organize code, and build more readable programs.

#### 🧠 Key Concepts:

* Defining a method: `public static void greet() { ... }`
* Parameters and arguments
* Return values: `public static int add(int a, int b)`
* Method overloading (optional for later)
* Method calling: `greet();`

#### 💡 Projects:

* **Greeting Generator**: Create a method `greet(name)` that prints a personalized greeting.
* **Simple Calculator**: Create `add()`, `subtract()`, `multiply()`, `divide()` methods and call them based on user input.
* **Tip Calculator Refactor**: Take your previous tip calculator and break it into input, calculation, and output methods.
* **Even/Odd Checker**: Method that takes an integer and prints if it's even or odd.
* **Basic Unit Converter**: Write methods for `cmToInches`, `fahrenheitToCelsius`, `poundsToKg`, etc.

---

### 📋 2. Lists – Managing Collections of Data

**Goal:** Learn how to store, loop through, and manage collections of items using Lists (specifically `ArrayList`).

#### 🧠 Key Concepts:

* Importing and declaring: `ArrayList<String> items = new ArrayList<>();`
* Adding/removing items: `add()`, `remove()`
* Accessing items: `get(index)`, `set(index, value)`
* Looping through lists
* `.size()` method
* Searching within a list

#### 💡 Projects:

* **To-Do List App**: Let the user add, view, and remove tasks from a list.
* **Grocery List Tracker**: Similar to To-Do but with quantities and prices. You could add total cost later.
* **Simple Quiz App**: Store questions and check answers using lists.
* **Movie Watchlist**: Add/remove/display movies, maybe with a `markAsWatched()` function.
* **Vocab Builder**: Store new vocabulary words and quiz the user.

---

### 🗺️ 3. Maps – Associating Keys with Values

**Goal:** Learn how to associate keys with values (like a dictionary) using `HashMap`.

#### 🧠 Key Concepts:

* Importing and declaring: `HashMap<String, Integer> scores = new HashMap<>();`
* Putting values: `put(key, value)`
* Getting values: `get(key)`
* Checking keys/values: `containsKey()`, `containsValue()`
* Removing entries: `remove(key)`
* Iterating through entries

#### 💡 Projects:

* **Phone Book App**: Store names as keys and phone numbers as values.
* **Word Counter**: Count occurrences of each word in a sentence.
* **Student Gradebook**: Map student names to letter grades or GPA.
* **Currency Converter**: Map currency codes to conversion rates.
* **Restaurant Menu App**: Map item names to prices; let the user place orders and calculate total.

---

### 🧩 Project Ideas That Combine All of the Above

These ideas require methods, lists, and maps working together:

* **Rock, Paper, Scissors (vs Computer)**: Use methods for logic, and lists/maps to manage choices.
* **Dice Guessing Game**: Use random numbers and user input, refactor with methods.
* **Text-Based RPG Inventory System**: Use a map for item names and quantities, and a list to store equipped items.
* **Restaurant Ordering System**: Show a menu (map), let user pick items (list), and print receipt with totals (method).
* **Flashcard App**: Map questions to answers, use methods to quiz, use lists to track incorrect ones for review.
