* Method overloading (optional for later)
* Method calling: `greet();`

#### 💡 Projects:

* **Greeting Generator**: Create a method `greet(name)` that prints a personalized greeting.
* **Simple Calculator**: Create `add()`, `subtract()`, `multiply()`, `divide()` methods and call them based on user input.
* **Tip Calculator Refactor**: Take your previous tip calculator and break it into input, calculation, and output methods.
* **Even/Odd Checker**: Method that takes an integer and prints if it's even or odd.
* **Basic Unit Converter**: Write methods for `cmToInches`, `fahrenheitToCelsius`, `poundsToKg`, etc.

---

### 📋 2. Lists – Managing Collections of Data

**Goal:** Learn how to store, loop through, and manage collections of items using Lists (specifically `ArrayList`).

* Looping through lists
* `.size()` method
* Searching within a list

#### 💡 Projects:

* **To-Do List App**: Let the user add, view, and remove tasks from a list.

#### 🧠 Key Concepts:

* Importing and declaring: `HashMap<String, Integer> scores = new HashMap<>();`
* Putting values: `put(key, value)`
* Getting values: `get(key)`
* Checking keys/values: `containsKey()`, `containsValue()`
* Removing entries: `remove(key)`
* Iterating through entries

#### 💡 Projects:

* **Phone Book App**: Store names as keys and phone numbers as values.
* **Word Counter**: Count occurrences of each word in a sentence.
* **Student Gradebook**: Map student names to letter grades or GPA.

### 🛠️ **Using Postman to Explore APIs**

**Why Postman?**
Postman is a popular tool that lets you send HTTP requests to APIs without writing any code — great for understanding how APIs work and testing endpoints.

#### Step-by-step guide:

1. **Install Postman**
   Download from [https://www.postman.com/downloads/](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).

2. **Create a New Request**

   * Open Postman and click “New” → “Request.”
   * Enter the API endpoint URL (e.g., `https://icanhazdadjoke.com/`).

3. **Set the HTTP Method**
   Choose GET, POST, etc., based on API docs.

4. **Set Headers**

   * For example, add header `Accept: application/json` to get JSON response.
   * Add API keys or tokens if required.

5. **Send the Request**
   Click “Send” and inspect the response:

   * Status code (e.g., 200 OK)
   * Response body (JSON or other data)
   * Response time and size

6. **Test Different Endpoints & Parameters**

   * Modify URL parameters or request body.
   * See how the API behaves with different inputs.

7. **Save Requests and Collections**
   Organize your API calls for reuse and sharing.

---

### 🧪 **Sample Postman Exercises**

* **Fetch a Random Joke** from [icanhazdadjoke.com](https://icanhazdadjoke.com/api)
* **Get Current Weather** by city name from OpenWeatherMap
* **Search Movies** with OMDb API by title
* **Retrieve Dog Images** from Dog CEO API

Use Postman to experiment with these APIs first — understand inputs, outputs, and errors.

---

### 🛠️ **Java API Calls**

After exploring APIs with Postman, you’ll learn how to:

* Use Java’s `HttpClient` (Java 11+) or `HttpURLConnection` to make HTTP requests
* Set headers and query parameters programmatically
* Parse JSON responses with Gson or Jackson libraries
* Handle errors and edge cases (timeouts, bad responses)
